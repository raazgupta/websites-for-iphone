Unhappy Security Dialogs
It&#8217;s annoying, yes. 
But it&#8217;s actually a great idea gone wrong.
 As you know, Windows users are forever downloading stupidly suspicious executable files and then running them, typically with god privileges.
&#8220;Aha!&#8221; exclaimed an optimistic Windows developer, &#8220;what if there were some way to tell the 
good
 programs from the bad?&#8221;
Did it work? Well, sort of. The 
technical
 aspects work just fine:
The certificate is a signed by a trusted provider, so it&#8217;s likely the software&#8217;s creator is trusted as well.
The file includes a checksum, so you can&#8217;t modify it and then pass it on as genuine.
But alas, 
this is yet another security feature tarnished by idealism.
Take a look at what the warning for 
signed
 binaries looks like:
Notice the difference? 
After all that work, 
you&#8217;ve been promoted from &#8220;angry red popup&#8221; to &#8220;angry orange popup!&#8221; 
So the dialog will either say &#8220;you are running unsigned code, which is bad&#8221; or &#8220;you are running signed code, which is 
probably
 bad&#8221;. 
It never says &#8220;you&#8217;re OK&#8221;.
This sends two messages:
(To publishers)
 Signing your binaries is nice, but not that big of a deal.
(To users)
 Ignore this dialog. 
This is rather different than the original goal of the dialog, which was &#8220;distinguish between signed and unsigned binaries&#8221;.
You see, Microsoft has fallen into the common trap of trying to 
moralize its users
. It&#8217;s a common temptation; it&#8217;s why Firefox used to make you wait 5 seconds to install extensions, or click through five pages of UI to accept a self-signed certificate.
If your users are trying to do something risky, you have only two options:
Ban the behavior outright.
Give the user useful information so they can make an informed decision.
&#8220;Being a pain in the ass&#8221; isn&#8217;t an option.
 It just makes people ignore and despise you. Did you know that Firefox 3&#8242;s original &#8220;self signed certificate&#8221; warning required 
11 steps
 to bypass? Users thought 
Firefox
 was broken, not them:
Treat your users like children, and they&#8217;ll ignore every word out of your mouth.
Signed programs:
Unsigned programs:
It&#8217;s clear and direct. It&#8217;s not perfect (as said before, a SSL certificate isn&#8217;t a 100% gauruntee of safety), but it should make an obvious difference between running 
DropboxInstaller.exe
 and 
IMBuddy2011.exe
. And who knows, people might actually look at it this way.
Update: Improved the wording of the &#8220;signed&#8221; dialog.

You are incorrect about Firefox&#8217;s installer dialog &#8211; see

 and

The Firefox dialog isn&#8217;t done for the same reason. It was added to prevent malicious software faking a click to install itself.

Sure, I think you have a very good point, but in your proposed design I think the unsigned dialog should be a bit more scary.

Good post, but what&#8217;s with the &#8220;(4)&#8221; -text in the Run-button in the Signed screen?
